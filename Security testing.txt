Cross-site report forgery(CSRF) = Checking URL Navigation paths like ?username%Password, whether these all are encrypted if that path is showing without encryption that is security defect. Hackers might can get the bank acc numbers all they can able to get.
Cross-site scripting(XSS)= XSS is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into a web page, which is then executed in another user's browser. It can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or phishing.. Like some random popup saying like click me- (Injecting malicious scripts into a web page viewed by others)
   Example(Normal Comment in a Blog: <script>alert('Hacked!');</script> displays this comment directly without filtering, then any user who views that page will see a popup — and worse, more harmful scripts could run silently.)
Prevention: Use Security Libraries: Like OWASP Java Encoder or frameworks with built-in XSS protection.

What is security testing? Why is it important?
Expected Answer:
Security testing is done to identify vulnerabilities in software that may lead to data breaches or unauthorized access. It's important to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.

What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration Testing, also known as Pen Testing or Ethical Hacking, is a security testing technique where authorized testers simulate real cyberattacks to find and fix vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks.

Have you ever done any basic security testing in your project?If yes, explain like:
I validated login/authentication flows, ensured secure password policies, checked if sensitive data like tokens or passwords are masked or encrypted, and ran basic scans using OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.


What are the different types of security testing?
Expected Answer:
Vulnerability scanning
Penetration testing
Risk assessment
Security auditing
Ethical hacking
Posture assessment


Security Testing = Prevention + Detection + Testing
Penetration Testing = Simulated Attack to Test Defense

What is the difference between security testing and penetration testing?
Expected Answer:
Security testing is a broad process to find all potential vulnerabilities, while penetration testing is a specific technique that simulates real-world attacks to check if those vulnerabilities can be exploited.


Real Time Example:
Security Testing is like checking the doors, windows, and locks of your house to ensure they are strong.

Penetration Testing is like hiring a burglar to try breaking in, so you can see how secure your house really is.

Security Testing,
Security Testing is a broad process used to make sure that software or applications are safe from threats or attacks.

Goal of Security Testing:
To find and fix weaknesses (vulnerabilities) that could let unauthorized users:

Steal data
Modify information
Crash the system
Gain unauthorized access

Example Tasks in Security Testing:
Making sure users can't log in without the correct password.
Checking that sensitive data (like credit card numbers) is encrypted.
Verifying that user roles and permissions work properly.
Ensuring session tokens expire after logout.
Tools: 	Burp Suite, ZAP, Nessus, Fortify

Penetration Testing,
Penetration Testing (or Pen Testing) is a type of security testing where a tester pretends to be a hacker and tries to break into the system.

Goal of Penetration Testing:
To simulate a real-world cyberattack and find out:
How easily a hacker can get in
What damage they could do
Where the system is vulnerable

Example Pen Testing Scenarios:
Trying to bypass login without knowing the password.
Attempting SQL Injection to pull data from the database.
Running cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to manipulate web pages.
Testing how the system reacts to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Tools: Burp Suite, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Nmap
